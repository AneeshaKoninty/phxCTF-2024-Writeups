# mugshot.jpg flag

This is a very simple steganography flag. A steganography is the practice of hiding info in essetially plain sight. This flag revolves around mugshot.jpg, which can be found in the about page in the Akhiller website.
This flag also deals with hashes.
To solve this challenge, we can use steghide, to extract data from this image. Steghide can be installed on Linux or Windows. For simplicity, I will use Linux.
I navigated to the directory of mugshot.jpg, and ran this steghide command `steghide extract -sf mugshot.jpg`. After this, it may ask for a passphrase, which you can leave blank. 
Now, you'll get a response saying
`wrote extracted data to 'flag.txt'`.
All we have to do is read flag.txt to find the info in the image, by typing `nano flag.txt`.
Upon reading this file, we see only this: `e1a1f0be30cefc7d857ea6408cd00a12`.

This is an MD5 hash, a 128-bit hash algorithm. More info can be found [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/md5-hash-stuff-means-technology-explained/).

All we have to do is paste this into dcode.fr, a website dedicated for ciphers and hashes. Hashes are not decodable, so dcode has to compare this hash value to known hash values. This is called a dictionary attack, and this works by comparing this hash to hashes of words in the English dictionary. This sounds time consuming but with a computer it can be very fast, especially if its a common word. 
Upon completion, it should give you "potatoes" which is the flag.
