find the secret message:

For this challenge, you were prompted to download an executable file, “check.exe”
Solve this using a Kali Linux VM (or another way to access the terminal), 
One way to solve this would be to to download the file within the terminal, and enter “./check.exe” in the terminal, which would print the flag, “Banana is the worst fruit”’
Another way would be to enter “strings check.exe” in the terminal, looking through the results before confirming the out of place “Banana is the worst fruit” as the flag
